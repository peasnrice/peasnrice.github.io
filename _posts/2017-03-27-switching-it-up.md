title: Switching it up
---
Having beaten Zelda: Breath of the Wild, my Nintendo Switch hasn't been used much. After defeating Ganon there was no real drive to go back to Hyrule and I can only repurchase The Binding of Isaac so many times before needing something new. Having seen a lot of posts on [r/nintendoswitch](http://reddit.com/r/nintendoswitch) showing custom Joy Con paint jobs I figured I'd give it a go. I figured it couldn't be so difficuly if so many people are doing it so i gave it a shot.

## The Equipment
[Mastercraft Specialty Precision Electornics Bit Set, 66-pc](http://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/mastercraft-specialty-precision-electronics-bit-set-66-pc-0573624p.html) - alright, so I was impatient and wanted to get the Y0 tri-wing screwdriver that you need to open the Switch up and didn't want to wait for shipping... So I ended up getting this set and it worked perfectly, albeit a little overkill as I only needed two of the bits...

[3M Wetordry Sandpaper, 4 x 9-in, 5-pk](http://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/3m-wetordry-sandpaper-4-x-9-in-5-pk-0475844p.html#srp) - I didn't want anything too coarse and figured this was fine enough to remove the top protective coating on the Switch controllers. 

[MTN 94 - RV 207 / Mango](http://www.mtncolors.com/product/mtn-94/) - I heard Montana Gold was the best paint to use, being in Canada Montana Gold isn't available, I was told that this was the next best thing. I picked this up at a local Graffiti Store in Montreal []Le Sino](http://www.lesino.com/)

[MTN 94 Specialty](http://www.montanacolors.com/webapp/spray?id=564) - For the top layer I went with an acrylic Matt varnish

## The Process
### Building Confidence
First we needed to find a resputable site that explains how to dissassemble the Switch Joy Cons. [iFixit here we come.](https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Nintendo+Switch+Teardown/78263) Unfortunately I found the tutorial a little more centered around the individual components rather than the process of getting the housing off of them. This meant that once the intial housing was off we were on our own for the most part. The biggest source of encouragement and confidence came from those that had already been through this process, again, it can;t be that difficult can it? 

### Removing, not disconnecting
Following these tutorials led me to removing components, starting with the haptic feedback motors. These came out fairly easily with a pair of tweezers. Once the motors were out I tried to disconnect the battery but didn't have too much luck. All the components looked quite well insulated so I decided that this wasn't terribly important and continued dissassembling without unplugging any more components. USE A TRAY if you are doing this, there are ~8 screws for each Joy-Con and god help you if you lose one. 

This article is a work in progress... more to come shortly...
