title: Switching up the Switch
---

Having beaten Zelda: Breath of the Wild, the Nintendo Switch hasn't been used much. After defeating Ganon there was no real drive to go back to Hyrule and I can only repurchase The Binding of Isaac so many times before wanting something new. 

Having seen a lot of posts on [r/nintendoswitch](http://reddit.com/r/nintendoswitch) showing custom Joy Con paint jobs I figured it couldn't be too difficult. After all this is a console in high demand and difficult to get a hold of. If others are risking breaking their $100 controllers it can't be too difficult can it? 

### The Result
