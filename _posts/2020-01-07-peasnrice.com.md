title: PeasNRice.com (This Blog)
---
A personal blog to document and showcase my side projects. It is quite meta as the blog itself was a project of mine to create a headless/static blog that was blazing fast and easy to maintain using freely available tools.
The site currently receives a [Page Insight Speed Score of 99](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=peasnrice.com).
I use Image Magick to optimize images for upload.

## Technologies
* Hosting: [Github](https://github.com/peasnrice/peasnrice.github.io)
* Blog Framework: [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
* Languages: 
	* HTML
	* CSS
    * Markdown
* Image Compression: [Image Magick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php)

## Future Developments
* Create a build process that automatically generate images required and bake them into the deployment process. 
* Improve Page Insight Score to 100.
* Add new articles for all projects.
